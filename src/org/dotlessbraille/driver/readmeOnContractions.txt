There are 9 categories of contractions. Each category needs to be handled according to its individual characteristics.  Also in some cases there are special rules for individual contractions.

Note that contractions are not used in grade 1, i.e. non-grade 2.  However, letters are of course used as theselves in grade 1 mode.  Also some of the same braille cells used as contractions in grade 1 are used as math symbols or parts of multi-clel math in grade 1. Also note that the explicit numeric mode indicator turns on a specical (hidden) grade 1 word mode.

UEB information emphasizes that the same PRINT symbol is always forward translated by the same BRAILLE symbol. This seems to be true. However, the reverse is definitely not true!  Some BRAILLE symbols  are backtranslated to more than one PRINT symbol depending on context and/or the braille mode. Some contractions have a specila math "layout" meaning in (possibly local) grade 1.
 
Letters a-j are decimal digits in numeric mode .

A few contractions signs including  SUBSUP en, in  5 9
FRAC  of,   with,  ( )  FENCE   126  gh  ar 345 < > Ascii Braille
have mathematical meaning in grade 1 "layouts, not math symbols but used
in math markup like MathML"

===============================================================================
10.1 23 letters (all except for A, I, and O) are used as whole word contractionsi in g2 but only IF they "standing alone." Otherwise they represent the print letters.
   Example: 1 braile cell:  g2  Example: p for person or letter p

10.2 There are xx strong wordsigns consits of a single root cell.  They can be used anywhere in a word as  a part-word contraction in g2.  They are only used as whole-word contractions when "standing alone"/
   Example: 1 character g2   Example dotsxx for 

10.3 The so-called large signs have the same meaning whether used as whole words or part words contractions. 1 character only grade 2 (OF, WITH) 
    1 braile cell: and, for, of, the, with

10.4 12 common just contractions, single roots
ed, ou, ow, ch, gh, sh, th, wh, st,  ing, ar, er  (GH, AR)

10.5 Low Words weirdos be, in, enough, his, was, were  (EN, IN)

10.6 context-depeendent single lower-cell roots ea, bb, etc.

======================================================================

10.7 2-cell prefix root including the dot-5 ones  "initial letter contractions"

10.8 context-dependent 2-cell prefix-root such as "ity" "final letter contractions"

10.9 short-forms  at least two letters or con+letter useage as stand-alone or in words requires "print to braille"  dictionary (explicit list) as NOT prefix-root
