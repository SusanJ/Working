# Working
Extended version of previous BakUEB Java app; current development in progress starting April 2021.
The two .g4 files are my ANTLR 4 grammars.

Using the app or any of the ANTLR 4 tools requires having a local copy of version 4.9.2 of the ANTLR 4 jar file whid is availble ehere: 
https://www.antlr.org/download.html

In case you aren't familiar with Java j ar files they are the standard way of distributing Java libraries and also Java executables.  Jar files can be used direclty on most machines; they don't require installers, etc. All they requre is a local copy of the the JRE or Java Runtime environment.  You machine may alredy have this.  If not it can be download from here:
https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

Of course once I stop making frequent changea to the app it will be appropriate to "jar up" the necessary files so as distribute the executable for beta testing..

I currently do all my development in Windows 10  on my Surface laptop.  I use a very old-fashioned approach.  I do not use an IDE (Integrated Development Environmnt) or similar tools.   I just use the Windows Command Prompt and Windows Batch (.bat) files like the ones included here. This approach results in a  fast development cycle of a minute or so to make a simple change, create and compile or compile  affected file(s), and do several quick tests. The directory I work in uses a standard Java approach to organizing class files in folders and subfolders as is also done here.
