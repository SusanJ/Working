# Working
Extended version of previous BakUEB Java app; current development in progress starting April 2021.
The two .g4 files are my ANTLR 4 grammars.

Using any of the tools requires having a local copy of version 4.9.2 of the ANTLR 4 jar file whid is availble ehere: 
https://www.antlr.org/download.html

In case you aren't familiar with Java j ar files they are the standard way of distributing Java libraries and also Java executables.  Jar files can be used direclty on most machines; they don't require installers, etc. All they requre is a local cop of the the JRE or Java Runtime environment.  You machine may alredy have oe of these.  If not download from here:
https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp

Of course once I stop making frequent change to the app s it will be appropriate to "jar up" the necessary files so as distribute the executable.
