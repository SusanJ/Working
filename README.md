Extended version of previous BakUEB Java apd; current development in progress starting April 2021.
The two .g4 files are my ANTLR 4 grammars.

Using any of the alternatives requires having a local copu of version 4.9.2 of the ANTLR 4 jar file whid is availbl ehere:

In case you aren't familiar with Java jar files are the standard way of distribution Java libraries and also Java executables.  Jar files can be used direclty on most machines; they don't require installers, etc.. Of course nce I stop making frequent changes it will be appropriate to "jar up" the necessary files so as distribute the executable.
